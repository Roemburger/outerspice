            <p>Before the world woke up, he was already moving. A programmer with a restless drive to create value, he’d push his limits—coding late, working out before dawn, feeling the heat rise as the sky stretched vast, dark, and full of stars. Then, in the quiet after, he’d sit outside with a cup of coffee—breathing, reflecting, grateful for life and the people around him.</p>
            <p>But in the lingering warmth of his workout, hot coffee felt wrong. He craved something cold. Something bold. So he began experimenting—brewing, cooling, infusing. A hit of cinnamon launched his journey into the realm of spices, unlocking bold, unexpected depth in the cold brew. What started as a ritual became a mission.</p>
            <p>And that’s how Outerspice was born.</p>
            <p>Those early mornings, staring up at the stars, felt like a glimpse into outer space—silent, infinite, daring him to push beyond the ordinary. Outerspice is that push—born from his drive, now fuel for those daring to chase the outer edge and create their own extraordinary. It’s bold like the spices that define it, unexpected like a star igniting in the dark, limitless like the code he writes and the horizons he chases.</p>
            <p class="name-story">Outerspice is outer space in a sip—where the dark sky of coffee meets a universe of flavor, and spices like cinnamon shine as stars. Born under a coder’s starry dawn, it’s a brew that dares you to taste the infinite.</p>
